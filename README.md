STARE AT THE SUN
----------------
Stare at The Sun is an angst ridden self reflection on the uncertainty that comes from trying to find your own way in life.
Trying to make sense of the world around you; unfortunately you keep coming up short, not knowing what’s the best thing for you to do.
You know that there’s something out there that you're looking for and you're so ready to get it that it hurts. People will often plant a kiss on a sacred altar or statue for a special blessing. The scars he refers to are the scars that come about through hard work and living a hard life.



BETWEEN THE END AND WHERE WE LIE
--------------------------------
This song is about being found in a dark and disorienting place, dreaming and somehow knowing that there is something more real and free outside in daylight. A casino functions as a metaphor for this world while searching for that greater, more real, spiritual reality beyond it.
This song also contains many references to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. In that story, a group of people are chained in a cave, and all that they’ve ever seen is the inside of the cave. One man manages to break his chains and escapes from the cave, freeing himself to see the world outside. At first, he’s startled by the brightness of the daylight, but his eyes begin to adjust and he sees the world for what it is. Then, he goes back to the cave to get everyone else out and show them the outside world, but they refuse.



CRUEL MELODY
------------
Open for interpretation. Definitely yearning for someone. To dissolve into them. Feeling hard done by. Shitty circumstance. Like your past is something you can't escape.



ATLANTIC
--------
“Atlantic” was the working title because it felt cold and lonely to me, and we ended up keeping it. I wrote a couple of complete sets of lyrics to this song in the studio. In the end, it turned out to be a love song, which is a little rare for us, but I think the song is so beautiful that it would be a shame if it were about anything less than love.
- FAST FACT: a glockenspiel was used on this song



FOR MILES
---------
“For Miles” is an acknowledgement of the wounds that life inflicts along our journey, but also a song of confident hope that all the wrongs will be made right one day at the end of time.
It is also an encouragement to become vulnerable with each other because it is only then that love and healing is found.



VILLAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCE
-----------------------
Is “Villains Of Circumstance” a love song? Of course. I won’t be here forever and when I’m gone, I want to have left things for my little people that will last a long time. They will get that later. I don’t want to pen it in so much but the lyric ‘Dream me home’ is when you lay your head down and across a vast ocean, someone else is laying their down and you can say all the words you know but it doesn’t matter, you’re still oceans apart. And they don’t understand, you know. I think that’s why I love the music so much because I can’t explain it all away for someone who doesn’t get it but I can play it and it seems so much more right. I have watched people cry over that one already because they understand.

The imagery drawn by Boneface for the song features a severed hand, its digits melting into dripping wax as the flames flicker where the nails once were, with red string wrapped around the index and pinkie fingers forming a ‘V’ over the top of the wrist.

The red string could be representative of the red thread of fate, an Eastern Asian belief derived from legend, that in some myths depicts a red string tied around the pinkie or little finger that binds those who are destined to meet and/or help each other.

Taking this into context of the lyrics, it’s easy to interpret that the candle-like hand is a light in the darkness guiding his loved ones to this moment in time when he recorded a message of love, the red string binding them across the (physical and metaphorical) distance that separates them.
