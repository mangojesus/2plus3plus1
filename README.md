STARE AT THE SUN
----------------
Stare at The Sun is an angst ridden self reflection on the uncertainty that comes from trying to find your own way in life.
Trying to make sense of the world around you; unfortunately you keep coming up short, not knowing what’s the best thing for you to do.
You know that there’s something out there that you're looking for and you're so ready to get it that it hurts. People will often plant a kiss on a sacred altar or statue for a special blessing. The scars he refers to are the scars that come about through hard work and living a hard life.



BETWEEN THE END AND WHERE WE LIE
--------------------------------
This song is about being found in a dark and disorienting place, dreaming and somehow knowing that there is something more real and free outside in daylight. A casino functions as a metaphor for this world while searching for that greater, more real, spiritual reality beyond it.
This song also contains many references to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. In that story, a group of people are chained in a cave, and all that they’ve ever seen is the inside of the cave. One man manages to break his chains and escapes from the cave, freeing himself to see the world outside. At first, he’s startled by the brightness of the daylight, but his eyes begin to adjust and he sees the world for what it is. Then, he goes back to the cave to get everyone else out and show them the outside world, but they refuse.



CRUEL MELODY
------------
Open for interpretation. Definitely yearning for someone. To dissolve into them. Feeling hard done by. Shitty circumstance. Like your past is something you can't escape.



ATLANTIC
--------
“Atlantic” was the working title because it felt cold and lonely to me, and we ended up keeping it. I wrote a couple of complete sets of lyrics to this song in the studio. In the end, it turned out to be a love song, which is a little rare for us, but I think the song is so beautiful that it would be a shame if it were about anything less than love.
- FAST FACT: a glockenspiel was used on this song



FOR MILES
---------
“For Miles” is an acknowledgement of the wounds that life inflicts along our journey, but also a song of confident hope that all the wrongs will be made right one day at the end of time.
It is also an encouragement to become vulnerable with each other because it is only then that love and healing is found.



VILLAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCE
-----------------------
Is “Villains Of Circumstance” a love song? Of course. I won’t be here forever and when I’m gone, I want to have left things for my little people that will last a long time. They will get that later. I don’t want to pen it in so much but the lyric ‘Dream me home’ is when you lay your head down and across a vast ocean, someone else is laying their down and you can say all the words you know but it doesn’t matter, you’re still oceans apart. And they don’t understand, you know. I think that’s why I love the music so much because I can’t explain it all away for someone who doesn’t get it but I can play it and it seems so much more right. I have watched people cry over that one already because they understand.

The imagery drawn by Boneface for the song features a severed hand, its digits melting into dripping wax as the flames flicker where the nails once were, with red string wrapped around the index and pinkie fingers forming a ‘V’ over the top of the wrist.

The red string could be representative of the red thread of fate, an Eastern Asian belief derived from legend, that in some myths depicts a red string tied around the pinkie or little finger that binds those who are destined to meet and/or help each other.

Taking this into context of the lyrics, it’s easy to interpret that the candle-like hand is a light in the darkness guiding his loved ones to this moment in time when he recorded a message of love, the red string binding them across the (physical and metaphorical) distance that separates them.


SWORD IN MOUTH, FIRE EYES
-------------------------
The subject has endured past relationships founded on "lies" that left them feeling "loveless" and "helpless." Entering a new bond, they cautiously assess their feelings ("weigh our thoughts") fearful of further hurt.

"There is no lament in taking chances" suggests the subject embraces risk and uncertainty as part of the journey toward self-discovery. Rather than dwell on perceived failures, focus remains on future growth. Emerging from trauma, it hints at how challenging oneself, even if resulting in "falls", leads to psychological elevation. Temporary setbacks ("falling") precede higher states of empowerment ("soaring").

Yet this partner inspires passionate devotion ("fire eyes") and an intimacy where the subject finds solace in surrendering control ("helplessness we love"). Their lover encourages self-understanding ("reflection") on a journey of change.

Where past encounters shaped destructive tendencies ("sheep to wolf"), this union strengthens resolve to overcome. The calm comfort offered finally allows stormy emotions to surface ("calm before the storm").

"Loveless without shame" seems to indicate a state of emotional deprivation and self-blame from past dysfunctional bonds. Lacking healthy intimacy and acceptance, feelings of unworthiness emerged.

Yet "shame" can imply a misplaced shame - the subject's self-worth did not truly necessitate such an emotion. Their prior "loveless" condition existed for reasons beyond personal deficiency. In this context "loveless without shame" portrays damage wrought by life events rather than intrinsic flaws.

With compassion, their partner guides acknowledgment of lingering guilt in a quiet space of acceptance ("silence of our own guilt"). This also shows finding solace in sharing burdens where once there was isolation. Through this process, buried wounds can scar over. 

With "the tongue was being sharpened by the lie", it seems to be referring to how past deceptions have made the subject wary and guarded in opening up. More willing to be outspoken to not accept less than desireable behavior from those around them. More willing to cut people down, and cut people out. They were conditioned to wield words as weapons ("sharpened tongue" + "sword in mouth") due to lies told. 

"Tell us all the things we need to know now" implies a desire to uncover blindspots and become wholely known/accepted. Also a desire from both sides to learn about themselves and each other. Tell me of my flaws and errors as  they happen so they don't pile up.

Rather than condemnation, their methods inspire ("gentle") and empower ("take our hand"). Traversing regions of the subject's past ("land I stole"), they help lay restless spirits to rest ("help us lay down").

This benevolent force facilitates personal enlightenment and healing. Their embrace liberates the subject to envision life unburdened and pursue true purpose. A redemptive relationship nurturing vulnerability, trust and growth.

Their new partner aims to assist in undoing the damage. By speaking authentic truths of comfort and empowerment, it soothes wounds where untruths once festered ("calm before the storm"). This restores the subject's ability to be genuinely vulnerable. "Shout it from the hell below" - surfacing repressed hurt and expressing it without shame. Looking to loose those demons.

"Shake us but be gentle" - facing hard realities is made bearable through delicate compassion

"Take our hand walk us through" continues the imagery of being guided from darkness into light

This line captures the nuanced approach needed in facing past pains. While such revelations may stir up turbulent emotions ("shake us") , the supportive partner handles them with utmost care ("gentle").

Rather than avoidance, this points to the importance of working through discomfort to find understanding and resolution. But it must be done with empathy, compassion and patience - not further trauma.

That delicate balance of radical honesty and gentleness seems key to real healing reflected here. Unearthing difficult truths demands courage, yet is made bearable by unconditional positive regard.

Overall it portrays laying bare the tattered pieces of one's psyche, and having them tenderly pieced back together. Old wounds see healing light and the soul finds peace, enabled by the redemptive love of this nurturing partner. Their presence allows facing life with authenticity and renewed purpose.
